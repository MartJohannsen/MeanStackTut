This tutorial was provided by Traversy Media, and it contained MongoDB (mlab), Express, Angular2(more on this) and NodeJS.

In itself it was a fine tutorial, and i feel like i've learned stuff. Mlab seems like a nice way to handle the mongoDB stuff, as it is able to cut out some of the steps needed to create on from Mongo directly.

As to node and express, there isn't much new, except for the way you implement an angular app. This was new, and i have now tried it.

in regards of Angular2 development, be aware, it seems to be outdated, as the current angular documentation isn't the same as the one in the guide.
To overcome this, i had to find the necessary code in BradTraversys repo he created, with the guide. He isn't really using the Angular CLI either, so no experience with that gained..

All in all it's a fine tutorial, even thou a bit dated. Research is needed.

As for now, my next step is to either find out how you implement current version angular apps into node, or try to create a page on my own.
